This README text provides an overview of a set of C programs that work with the `argc` and `argv` command-line arguments in different ways. Here's a summary of each task:

1. **0-whatsmyname.c:** This program prints its own name, including the path, followed by a new line. It doesn't require recompilation if you rename the program.

2. **1-args.c:** This program prints the number of arguments passed to it, followed by a new line.

3. **2-args.c:** This program prints all the arguments it receives, including the first one. Each argument is printed on a new line.

4. **3-mul.c:** This program multiplies two numbers provided as command-line arguments and prints the result. If it doesn't receive exactly two arguments, it prints "Error" and returns 1.

5. **4-add.c:** This program adds positive numbers provided as command-line arguments and prints the result. It handles various error cases, such as no numbers passed, non-digit symbols, and returns an error code if needed.

6. **100-change.c:** This program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount of money in cents. It has specific usage requirements, error handling for invalid inputs, and uses specific coin values (25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent).

Each program demonstrates different ways of working with command-line arguments and provides specific functionality as described in the README text.
